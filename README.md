# MUI Symbols 
A React icon library compatible with Material UI.

## Installation
```bash
npm install mui-symbols
```

## Usage
Use this library the same way you would use `@mui/icons-material`:
```typescript
// Named imports
import { Abc } from "mui-symbols";

// Default imports
import Abc from "mui-symbols/Abc";

// With different icon styles
import AbcOutlined from "mui-symbols/AbcOutlined"; // Outlined is the default style so this is the same as using "Abc"
import AbcRounded from "mui-symbols/AbcRounded";
import AbcSharp from "mui-symbols/AbcSharp";

// With fill
import AbcRoundedFill from "mui-symbols/AbcRoundedFill";
```
